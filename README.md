# Math 504: Advanced Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis

This repository will eventually contain a set of lecture notes for a [class on advanced linear algebra (Math 504, Fall 2021) at Drexel University](https://www.cip.ifi.lmu.de/~grinberg/t/21fala/index.html). The notes are joint work of Hugo Woerdeman, Darij Grinberg and student scribes.
